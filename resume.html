We're excited about the huge opportunity in democratizing mobile ordering to small-to-medium sized businesses; a revolution that has so long been spearheaded by large proprietary systems (think Panera Bread, Starbucks, and Chipotle). Still in prototyping stage.

Unfortunately Google got there before us with Google Popular Times, and the team has decided to move on (to Order Ahead!)
